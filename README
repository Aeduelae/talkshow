README for KommHELP Talkshow

Talkshow is a hierarchical sound board application for portable touch screen computers. It is meant to help non-speaking people.

Talkshow is based on python and the pyglet library. It runs on Windows, OS X and Linux (not tested yet)

MOTIVATION

Non-speaking people depend on special devices to communicate with the people that surround them. There are devices on the market that play pre-recorded sound samples by pressing a button and allow the user to change sample sets according to context. However, these special device are ridiculously expensive.

With Talkshow, we try to provide a solution based solely on Open Source software that runs on a cheap Netbook with a touch screen.

LICENCE

Talkshow is licensed under the terms of the GPL. This means you can use it for whatever purpose you like. If you make changes to the code however, you need to make these changes available to the public.

INSTALLATION

You need to install a python interpreter for your platform (ActivePython for Windows for example) and the pyglet library.
Pyglet can be found here: http://www.pyglet.org/download.html
After you have installed these components, simply put the files that make up Talkshow into a new directory, open a command line and type:
<path-to-python-interpreter>/python talkshow.py

On windows, this might look like this:

c:\Python26\python talkshow.py
 
USGAE / CREATING CONTENT

The user interface consists of colored rectangles that either play a sound or contain more colored rectangles.
All rectangles have a caption and optionally may have an associated icon.
You create this hierarchy of rectangles by creating a hierarchy of subdirectories in the content directory, one subdirectory per rectangle. Each subdirectory may contain more subdirectories or a sound file in wav format and an image in png format that will be used as the rectangle's icon. The sound file will be played once the rectangle is touched in the UI. The name of the directory will be used as the caption of the rectangle.
See the provided content directory structure as an example.

If you create sample sets this way, please make them available to the public. I would be happy to hear about it. (my email address is at the end of this file)

There are three buttons on the bottom of the screen: The one on the left can be used to navigate to the parent rectangle (one step up in the hierarchy, sort of a "back button"), the middle button returns to the root of the hierarchy and the slider on the right finally can be used to adjust the volume.

TROUBLESHOOTING
